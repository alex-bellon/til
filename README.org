* Today I Learned

* I DECLARE FUN FACT BANKRUPTCY!!!! 

Below, I tried to have a new thing almost every day, but my backlog grew really big and eventually I had saved the link so long ago that I was just making up what day I learned it on. From here on out I'm just going to add facts when I can, and try to prevent another huge backlog. Not sure how/if I'm going to organize it.

Also, a lot of this just ended up being the same content as from my Wikipedia repo...

- Using the apostrophus method of roman numerals, 500 is written as IↃ, while 1,000 is written as CIↃ. This system of encasing numbers to denote thousands (imagine the Cs and Ↄs as parentheses) has its origins in Etruscan numeral usage. Each additional set of C and Ↄ surrounding CIↃ raises the value by a factor of ten: CCIↃↃ represents 10,000 and CCCIↃↃↃ represents 100,000. Similarly, each additional Ↄ to the right of IↃ raises the value by a factor of ten: IↃↃ represents 5,000 and IↃↃↃ represents 50,000. Numerals larger than CCCIↃↃↃ do not occur. Sometimes CIↃ is reduced to ↀ for 1,000. Similarly, IↃↃ for 5,000 is sometimes reduced to ↁ; CCIↃↃ for 10,000 to ↂ; IↃↃↃ for 50,000 to ↇ (ↇ); and CCCIↃↃↃ (ↈ) for 100,000 to ↈ.

The words, intended to be without meaning, were added as security padding in an encrypted message to hinder Japanese attempts at cryptanalysis, but were mistakenly included in the decoded text given to Halsey. Halsey interpreted the phrase as a harsh and sarcastic rebuke, and as a consequence dropped his futile pursuit of a decoy Japanese carrier task force, and, belatedly, reversed some of his ships in a fruitless effort to aid United States forces in the Battle off Samar.

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutellagate][Nutellagate]] was a controversy at Columbia University surrounding allegations of widespread student theft of dining hall Nutella. Columbia first began serving Nutella in its dining halls in February 2013. Within a month, future Pulitzer Prize winner Cecilia Reyes reported in the Columbia Daily Spectator that high demand for the spread was costing the university $5,000 per week, a figure reportedly calculated by Executive Director of Dining Services Vicki Dunn, as students were consuming up to 100 pounds of Nutella per day. In a school-wide email, Dunn accused students of filling cups with Nutella and stealing full jars from John Jay Dining Hall. It was estimated that at that rate, Nutella consumption would cost the university $250,000 a year, enough to buy seven jars for every undergraduate student. The high volume of Nutella consumption raised questions around food waste, dining hall meal plan costs, exorbitant tuition rates, and consumerism.The story quickly garnered national attention, and was reported the next day in The New York Times. The student blog Bwog calculated based on the original figure from the Spectator—$5,000 per week for 100 pounds per day—that unless the Spectator had misreported the numbers, the university was being charged 70% more for its Nutella than prices offered by local distributors. Two days after the Spectator article, the university clarified in a statement titled "NUTELLA-GATE EXPOSED: It's a Smear!" that the weekly cost of Nutella was actually less than one-tenth the reported amount, and that while in the first week the university spent $2,500 on Nutella, the cost had actually fallen to around $450 in following weeks.

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_demon][Maxwell's demon]] is a thought experiment that would hypothetically violate the second law of thermodynamics. It was proposed by the physicist James Clerk Maxwell in 1867. In his first letter, Maxwell referred to the entity as a "finite being" or a "being who can play a game of skill with the molecules". Lord Kelvin would later call it a "demon".In the thought experiment, a demon controls a small massless door between two chambers of gas. As individual gas molecules (or atoms) approach the door, the demon quickly opens and closes the door to allow only fast-moving molecules to pass through in one direction, and only slow-moving molecules to pass through in the other. Because the kinetic temperature of a gas depends on the velocities of its constituent molecules, the demon's actions cause one chamber to warm up and the other to cool down. This would decrease the total entropy of the system, without applying any work, thereby violating the second law of thermodynamics.

Stage productions of the play vary greatly, therefore, with between one and several actors in performance; the original production featured three actors. According to Kane's friend and fellow-playwright David Greig, the title of the play derives from the time, 4:48 a.m., when Kane, in her depressed state, often woke.

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletics_at_the_1904_Summer_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_marathon][The 1904 Olympics men's marathon was absolutely bonkers]]:
  - While Fred Lorz was greeted as the apparent winner, he was later disqualified as he had hitched a ride in a car for part of the race.
  - Thomas Hicks ended up the winner of the event, although he was aided by measures that would not have been permitted in later years. Ten miles from the finish, Hicks led the race by a mile and a half, but he had to be restrained from stopping and lying down by his trainers. From then until the end of the race, Hicks received several doses of strychnine (a common rat poison, which stimulates the nervous system in small doses) mixed with brandy in an egg white. He continued to battle onwards, hallucinating, barely able to walk for most of the course. When he reached the stadium, his support team carried him over the line, holding him in the air while he shuffled his feet as if still running. Hicks had to be carried off the track, and might have died in the stadium had he not been treated by several doctors. He lost eight pounds during the course of the marathon.
  - Another near-fatality during the event was William Garcia of the United States. He was found lying in the road along the marathon course with severe internal injuries caused by breathing the clouds of dust kicked up by the race officials' cars
  - Cuban postman Andarín Carvajal had also joined the marathon, arriving at the last minute. After losing all of his money gambling in New Orleans, Louisiana, he hitchhiked to St. Louis and had to run the event in street clothes that he cut around the legs to make them look like shorts. Not having eaten in 40 hours, he saw a spectator eating 2 peaches. He asked if he could have the peaches, and the spectator declined. He then stole both peaches and ran away. Later, he stopped off in an orchard en route to eat some apples, which turned out to be rotten. The rotten apples caused him to have strong stomach cramps, and he had to lie down and take a nap. Despite falling ill from the apples, and taking a nap, he still managed to finish in fourth place.
  - The South African entrants, Len Taunyane and Jan Mashiani, finished ninth and twelfth, respectively: this was a disappointment, as many observers were sure Tau could have done better if he had not been chased nearly a mile off course by wild dogs.
  - The only two sources of water for the competitors were a water tower at six miles and a well at about the 12-mile mark. James E. Sullivan was a chief organizer of the Olympics, and decided to allow only one water station on the 24.85 mile course of the marathon even though it was conducted in 32 °C (90 °F) heat over unpaved roads choked with dust. His ostensible reason was to conduct research on "purposeful dehydration", even though dehydration is potentially fatal.

Exceptions to public exposure were acceptable only if the people were subjects of demonstration, to illustrate the separation of disabled from nondisabled and their need for reformation.

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_blanking_interval][Horizontal blanking interval]] refers to a part of the process of displaying images on a computer monitor or television screen via raster scanning. CRT screens display images by moving beams of electrons very quickly across the screen. Once the beam of the monitor has reached the edge of the screen, the beam is switched off, and the deflection circuit voltages (or currents) are returned to the values they had for the other edge of the screen; this would have the effect of retracing the screen in the opposite direction, so the beam is turned off during this time. This part of the line display process is the Horizontal Blank. In detail, the Horizontal blanking interval consists of:
  - front porch -- blank while still moving right, past the end of the scanline,
  - sync pulse -- blank while rapidly moving left; in terms of amplitude, "blacker than black".
  - back porch -- blank while moving right again, before the start of the next scanline. Colorburst occurs during the back porch, and unblanking happens at the end of the back porch.

- fast (v.):
  - "abstain from food," Old English fæstan "to fast" (as a religious duty), also "to make firm; establish, confirm, pledge," from Proto-Germanic *fastanan "to hold, guard," extended to the religious act "observe abstinence" (source also of Old Frisian festia, Old High German fasten, German fasten, Old Norse fasta "abstain from food"), from the same root as fast (adj.). The original meaning in prehistoric Germanic was "hold firmly," and the sense evolved via "have firm control of oneself," to "hold oneself to observance" (compare Gothic fastan "to keep, observe," also "to fast"). Perhaps the Germanic sense shifted through use of the native words to translate Medieval Latin observare in its sense "to fast," or it might have been a loan-translation of a Greek expression brought to the Goths by Arian missionaries and spread from them to other Germanic peoples. The verb in the sense "to make fast" continued in Middle English, but was superseded by fasten.

The term "lunchtime attack" refers to the idea that a user's computer, with the ability to decrypt, is available to an attacker while the user is out to lunch. This form of the attack was the first one commonly discussed: obviously, if the attacker has the ability to make adaptive chosen ciphertext queries, no encrypted message would be safe, at least until that ability is taken away.

It is hypothesized that unusual forms of life could be found in the lake's liquid layer, a fossil water reserve. Because Lake Vostok may contain an environment sealed off below the ice for millions of years, the conditions could resemble those of ice-covered oceans hypothesized to exist on Jupiter's moon Europa, and Saturn's moon Enceladus.

*** Thu Dec 16
- Bodybuilders are chasing sarcoplasmic muscle, and powerlifters are chasing myofibrillar muscle. The difference between the two is weight and rep ranges, though there is an overlap between the muscle types. Sarcoplasmic muscle locks in energy resources (glucose, creatine, etc) between the muscle layers, so looks a bit 'bigger' comparative to strength, i.e. the extra layers created by the resources between muscle layers helps bulk it out, and look a bit bigger. Myofibrillar muscle will have more layers of muscle over any given area when compared to sarcoplasmic muscle. So it will be able to lift more per lb or kg of muscle, but will run out of energy more quickly.

*** Mon Nov 22
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_rebinding][DNS rebinding]] is an attack where a malicious web page causes visitors to run a client-side script that attacks machines elsewhere on the network.
  - The attacker registers a domain (such as attacker.com) and delegates it to a DNS server that is under the attacker's control. The server is configured to respond with a very short time to live (TTL) record, preventing the DNS response from being cached. When the victim browses to the malicious domain, the attacker's DNS server first responds with the IP address of a server hosting the malicious client-side code. For instance, they could point the victim's browser to a website that contains malicious JavaScript or Flash scripts that are intended to execute on the victim's computer. The malicious client-side code makes additional accesses to the original domain name (such as attacker.com). These are permitted by the same-origin policy. However, when the victim's browser runs the script it makes a new DNS request for the domain, and the attacker replies with a new IP address. For instance, they could reply with an internal IP address or the IP address of a target somewhere else on the Internet.

*** Sun Nov 7
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptovirology][Cryptovirology]] is a field that studies how to use cryptography to design powerful malicious software. The field was born with the observation that public-key cryptography can be used to break the symmetry between what an antivirus analyst sees regarding malware and what the attacker sees. The antivirus analyst sees a public key contained in the malware, whereas the attacker sees the public key contained in the malware as well as the corresponding private key (outside the malware) since the attacker created the key pair for the attack. The public key allows the malware to perform trapdoor one-way operations on the victim's computer that only the attacker can undo.

- The term "closed" (versus "open") in "closed captions" indicates that the captions are not visible until activated by the viewer, usually via the remote control or menu option.

- The United Kingdom, Ireland, and most other countries do not distinguish between subtitles and closed captions and use "subtitles" as the general term. The equivalent of "captioning" is usually referred to as "subtitles for the hard of hearing". Their presence is referenced on screen by notation which says "Subtitles", or previously "Subtitles 888" or just "888" (the latter two are in reference to the conventional videotext channel for captions), which is why the term subtitle is also used to refer to the Ceefax-based videotext encoding that is used with PAL-compatible video.

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Brassau][Pierre Brassau]] was a chimpanzee and the subject of a 1964 hoax perpetrated by Åke "Dacke" Axelsson, a journalist at the Swedish tabloid Göteborgs-Tidningen. Axelsson came up with the idea of exhibiting a series of paintings made by a non-human primate, under the pretense that they were the work of a previously unknown French artist named "Pierre Brassau", in order to test whether critics could tell the difference between true avant-garde modern art and the work of a chimpanzee.
  - While one critic observed that "only an ape could have done this", most praised the works. Rolf Anderberg of the Göteborgs-Posten wrote, "Brassau paints with powerful strokes, but also with clear determination. His brush strokes twist with furious fastidiousness. Pierre is an artist who performs with the delicacy of a ballet dancer." After the hoax was revealed, Anderberg insisted that Peter's work was "still the best painting in the exhibition".
- A [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_organ][cat organ]] is a hypothetical musical instrument which consists of a line of cats fixed in place with their tails stretched out underneath a keyboard so that they cry out when a key is pressed.

- Why are even numbered pages only ever on the left side of a book?
  - 

    #+begin_quote
    Each of the bound leaves of paper in a book is known in publishing as a folio.

    #+end_quote

  - 

    #+begin_quote
    The front side of a folio, or the "first" side which faces you, is known as the recto. Recto comes from the Latin for "right"and is a shortened form of rectō foliō or "right hand page". It also has the adverbial sense of "on the right hand side".

    #+end_quote

  - 

    #+begin_quote
    Hence the publishing convention that the recto or first page of a bound book is numbered "1" and is normally the right hand page.

    #+end_quote

  - 

    #+begin_quote
    The reverse side of a folio is the verso. This comes from the Latin vertĕre, "to turn", and refers to the side of the folio which faces you once it is turned. This second side is numbered "2" and is conventionally (and logically) a left-hand page.

*** Sat Sep 26
- The reason that the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem][Monty Hall problem]] gives you a 2/3 chance of being correct when you switch doors doesn't have much to do with the door being revealed - assuming your switch, your probability is already set when you pick your first door. This is because originally, you have a 2/3 chance of picking a goat. If the door you choose has a goat, and Monty reveals the goat in the 3rd door, then the car must be behind the door you didn't choose. Thus you should switch because you /know/ where the car is. 1/3 of the time, you pick the door with the car. When you switch, you switch to the door with another goat. But, this only happens 1/3 of the time, so it's to your advantage to switch every time, because you most likely picked the goat the first time.

- 57 is often called "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/57_(number)#In_mathematics][Groethendieck's prime]]" after a story in which mathematician Alexander Grothendieck supposedly gave it as an example of a particular prime number.
- A [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repdigit][repdigit]] (or monodigit) is a number that is made of a single number repeated multiple times
  - A [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repunit][repunit]] is a repdigit that uses only 1s
  - A [Brazilian number] is a number that can be written as a repdigit in some base, not allowing the repdigit 11.
- A [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_prime][Mersenne prime]] is a prime number that is one less that a power of two (and therefore can be represented by all 1s in binary)

- If you accidentally make/write in a file in =vim= without sudo, you can write the changes as sudo anyways by using =:w !sudo tee %=

*** Sun May 24
- I learned more words from my crosswords:
  - *Assent*: the expression of approval or agreement
  - *Bivouac*: a temporary camp without tents or cover, used especially by soldiers or mountaineers
  - *Lariat*: rope
  - *Pall*: become less appealing or interesting through familiarity
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing-up-my-sleeve_number][Nothing-up-my-sleeve numbers]] are numbers (in cryptography) that are above suspicion of hidden properties, based on how they are chosed or constructed.
- The "tropical" in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_geometry][tropical geometry]] because the person who first wrote on it was from Brazil.
- The en-dash (--) is the same width as a capital N, and is used to separate items in a list. The em-dash (---) is the same width as a capital M, and is used to signal a separate but related clause.

- The green stuff you eat in sushi restaurants is probably not real wasabi (it's more likely [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasabi#Surrogates][a combination of horseradish, mustard, and green food coloring]]). Real wasabi is very expensive because it only grows by fresh mountain streams in Japan. It requires rocky soil, constant fresh water, and has to be kept at a certain temperature. It then has to be harvested by hand, and when it is grated, it only retains it's flavor for ~30 minutes.
- Along with the classic "Alice" and "Bob" placeholders used in cryptography as placeholders for the names of different communicating parties, there is a whole [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob#Cast_of_characters][cast of characters]].
- Similarly, there are more variable names similar to "foo" and "bar", including [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasyntactic_variable][baz, qux, quux, quuz, corge, grault, garply, waldo, fred, plugh, xyzzy, and thud]].
  - Most notably, in Python (which is named after [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)#Naming][Monty Python, not the snake]]), the common variable placeholders are "spam" "ham" and "eggs" (from Monty Python's "Spam" sketch).

*** Fri May 22
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher#ARX_(add%E2%80%93rotate%E2%80%93XOR)][Add-Rotate-XOR]] algorithms (for cryptographic schemes) are popular because all of those functions run in constant time, and are therefore immune to timing attacks.
- The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interesting_number_paradox][Interesting Number Paradox]] states that if you were to categorize numbers as "interesting" and "uninteresting", then of the set of "uninteresting" numbers, the smallest number would be an interesting number (as it is the smallest uninteresting number).

*** Thu May 21
- I learned that [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frog#Digestion_and_excretion][frogs have teeth]], although they are very weak and are only used to hold food (not chew or bite prey). On the other hand, toads don't have any teeth.

*** Wed May 20
- The movie [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0286499/][Bend It Like Beckham]] was the first Western movie to be shown in North Korea.
- I also learned some more words from my crosswords that I've been doing:
  - *Peal*: a loud, prolonged ringing of bells
  - *Ply*: to carry on, practice, or pursue busily or steadily
  - *Denude*: to make bare
- As far as we know [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_monopole][magnetic monopoles]] do not exist. Whenever you break a magnet down, it will always have a "north" and "south" pole, no matter how small it is. This is in contrast to electric charges, where you can have something that is wholly positively or negatively charged.

*** Tue May 19
- I was doing some crosswords and learned these words:
  - *Abase*: to lower in rank, prestige or esteem
  - *Bung*: to close with a stopper
  - *Impel*: drive, force or urge to do something
  - *Prig*: self-righteous moralistic person
  - *Rector*: clergy who is in charge of a parish in the Episcopal church
- I also learned that [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiles%27s_proof_of_Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem][Andrew Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem]] was a proof by contradiction. He basically showed that if it was not true, then that would imply that a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity_theorem][proven theorem about elliptic curves]] would be false.
