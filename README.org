- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-body_problem_(career)][Two-body problem]] is a dilemma for life partners (e.g., spouses or any other couple) often referred to in academia, relating to the difficulty of both spouses obtaining jobs at the same university or within a reasonable commuting distance from each other. The inability of one partner to accommodate the other produces this central dilemma, which is a no-win situation in which if the couple wishes to stay together one of them may be forced to abandon an academic career, or if both wish to pursue academic careers the relationship may falter due to the spouses being constantly separated.

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4.48_Psychosis][4.48 Psychosis]] is the final play by British playwright Sarah Kane. It was her last work, first staged at the Royal Court's Jerwood Theatre Upstairs on 23 June 2000, directed by James Macdonald, nearly one and a half years after Kane's death on 20 February 1999. The play has no explicit characters or stage directions; this continues the style of her previous production entitled Crave. Stage productions of the play vary greatly, therefore, with between one and several actors in performance; the original production featured three actors. According to Kane's friend and fellow-playwright David Greig, the title of the play derives from the time, 4:48 a.m., when Kane, in her depressed state, often woke.

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumpers_and_splitters][Lumpers and splitters]] are opposing factions in any discipline that has to place individual examples into rigorously defined categories. The lumper–splitter problem occurs when there is the desire to create classifications and assign examples to them, for example schools of literature, biological taxa and so on. A "lumper" is an individual who takes a gestalt view of a definition, and assigns examples broadly, assuming that differences are not as important as signature similarities. A "splitter" is an individual who takes precise definitions, and creates new categories to classify samples that differ in key ways.

It was described in a New York Times article by Dinitia Smith in 1998: "For a fictional portrait to be actionable, it must be so accurate that a reader of the book would have no problem linking the two," said Mr. Friedman. Thus, he continued, libel lawyers have what is known as "the small penis rule". One way authors can protect themselves from libel suits is to say that a character has a small penis, Mr. Friedman said. "Now no male is going to come forward and say, 'That character with a very small penis, that's me!'"

- A [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_hat][cork hat]] is a type of headgear with corks strung from the brim, to ward off insects. Pieces of cork, typically bottle corks, are hung on strings from the brim of the hat. The low density of cork means a number of pieces may hang from a hat without significantly increasing its weight. Movement of the head causes the corks to swing, discouraging insects, particularly bush flies, from swarming around the wearer's head, or entering the nose or mouth. The shape and material of cork hats varies but, typically, they are similar to a slouch hat.

The orphan trains operated between 1854 and 1929, relocating about 250,000 children. The co-founders of the Orphan Train movement claimed that these children were orphaned, abandoned, abused, or homeless, but this was not always true. They were mostly the children of new immigrants and the children of the poor and destitute families living in these cities. Criticisms include ineffective screening of caretakers, insufficient follow-ups on placements, and that many children were used as strictly slave farm labor.

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diving_Bell_and_the_Butterfly][The Diving Bell and the Butterfly]] is a memoir by journalist Jean-Dominique Bauby. It describes his life before and after a massive stroke left him with locked-in syndrome. The entire book was written by Bauby blinking his left eyelid, which took ten months (four hours a day). Using partner assisted scanning, a transcriber repeatedly recited a French language frequency-ordered alphabet (E, S, A, R, I, N, T, U, L, etc.), until Bauby blinked to choose the next letter. The book took about 200,000 blinks to write and an average word took approximately two minutes. The book also chronicles everyday events for a person with locked-in syndrome.

*** Fri Aug 5
- A [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_crossing][level crossing]] is an intersection where a railway line crosses a road or path, or in rare situations an airport runway, at the same level, as opposed to the railway line crossing over or under using an overpass or tunnel. The term also applies when a light rail line with separate right-of-way or reserved track crosses a road in the same fashion.

  - A [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boom_barrier][boom barrier]] is a bar, or pole pivoted to allow the boom to block vehicular or pedestrian access through a controlled point.
  - A [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-quadrant_gate][four-quadrant gate]] is a type of boom barrier gate protecting a grade crossing. It has a gate mechanism on both sides of the tracks for both directions of automotive traffic. The exit gates blocking the road leading away from the tracks are equipped with a delay, and begin their descent to their horizontal position several seconds after the entrance gates do, so as to avoid trapping highway vehicles on the crossing.
  - A [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossbuck][crossbuck]] is a traffic sign used to indicate a level railway crossing. It is composed of two slats of wood or metal of equal length, fastened together on a pole in a saltire formation (resembling the letter X).
  - A [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistle_post][whistle post]] is a sign marking a location where a train driver is required to sound the horn or whistle.
    - A [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayside_horn][wayside horn]] is an audible signal used at level crossings. They can be used in place of, or in addition to, the locomotive's horn as the train approaches the crossing. They are often used in special railroad "quiet zones" in the United States, where the engineer is not required to sound the locomotive's horn at a crossing. This reduces the ambient noise at the crossing, which may be desirable in residential areas.
  - A [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigwag_(railroad)][wigwag]] is a nickname for a type of railroad grade crossing signal once common in North America, referring to its pendulum-like motion that signaled the approach of a train. The device is generally credited to Albert Hunt, a mechanical engineer at Southern California's Pacific Electric (PE) interurban streetcar railroad, who invented it in 1909 for safer railroad grade crossings
- The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakover_angle][breakover angle]] is the maximum possible supplementary angle (usually expressed in degrees) that a vehicle, with at least one forward wheel and one rear wheel, can drive over without the apex of that angle touching any point of the vehicle other than the wheels.
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_separation][Grade separation]] is a method of aligning a junction of two or more surface transport axes at different heights (grades) so that they will not disrupt the traffic flow on other transit routes when they cross each other. The composition of such transport axes does not have to be uniform; it can consist of a mixture of roads, footpaths, railways, canals, or airport runways. Bridges (or overpasses, also called flyovers), tunnels (or underpasses), or a combination of both can be built at a junction to achieve the needed grade separation.
- An [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_crossing][occupation crossing]] allows an landowner whose land is split in two by a (new) railway (or road) to retain access from one parcel of land to the other. Where is crossing a railway line, it is a special kind of railway level crossing.

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletics_at_the_1904_Summer_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_marathon][The 1904 Olympics men's marathon was absolutely bonkers]]:
  - While Fred Lorz was greeted as the apparent winner, he was later disqualified as he had hitched a ride in a car for part of the race.
  - Thomas Hicks ended up the winner of the event, although he was aided by measures that would not have been permitted in later years. Ten miles from the finish, Hicks led the race by a mile and a half, but he had to be restrained from stopping and lying down by his trainers. From then until the end of the race, Hicks received several doses of strychnine (a common rat poison, which stimulates the nervous system in small doses) mixed with brandy in an egg white. He continued to battle onwards, hallucinating, barely able to walk for most of the course. When he reached the stadium, his support team carried him over the line, holding him in the air while he shuffled his feet as if still running. Hicks had to be carried off the track, and might have died in the stadium had he not been treated by several doctors. He lost eight pounds during the course of the marathon.
  - Another near-fatality during the event was William Garcia of the United States. He was found lying in the road along the marathon course with severe internal injuries caused by breathing the clouds of dust kicked up by the race officials' cars
  - Cuban postman Andarín Carvajal had also joined the marathon, arriving at the last minute. After losing all of his money gambling in New Orleans, Louisiana, he hitchhiked to St. Louis and had to run the event in street clothes that he cut around the legs to make them look like shorts. Not having eaten in 40 hours, he saw a spectator eating 2 peaches. He asked if he could have the peaches, and the spectator declined. He then stole both peaches and ran away. Later, he stopped off in an orchard en route to eat some apples, which turned out to be rotten. The rotten apples caused him to have strong stomach cramps, and he had to lie down and take a nap. Despite falling ill from the apples, and taking a nap, he still managed to finish in fourth place.
  - The South African entrants, Len Taunyane and Jan Mashiani, finished ninth and twelfth, respectively: this was a disappointment, as many observers were sure Tau could have done better if he had not been chased nearly a mile off course by wild dogs.
  - The only two sources of water for the competitors were a water tower at six miles and a well at about the 12-mile mark. James E. Sullivan was a chief organizer of the Olympics, and decided to allow only one water station on the 24.85 mile course of the marathon even though it was conducted in 32 °C (90 °F) heat over unpaved roads choked with dust. His ostensible reason was to conduct research on "purposeful dehydration", even though dehydration is potentially fatal.

- Between 1867 and 1974, various cities of the United States had unsightly beggar ordinances, in retrospect also dubbed [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugly_law][ugly laws]]. These laws targeted poor people and disabled people. For instance, in San Francisco a law of 1867 deemed it illegal for "any person, who is diseased, maimed, mutilated or deformed in any way, so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object, to expose himself or herself to public view." Exceptions to public exposure were acceptable only if the people were subjects of demonstration, to illustrate the separation of disabled from nondisabled and their need for reformation.

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_blanking_interval][Horizontal blanking interval]] refers to a part of the process of displaying images on a computer monitor or television screen via raster scanning. CRT screens display images by moving beams of electrons very quickly across the screen. Once the beam of the monitor has reached the edge of the screen, the beam is switched off, and the deflection circuit voltages (or currents) are returned to the values they had for the other edge of the screen; this would have the effect of retracing the screen in the opposite direction, so the beam is turned off during this time. This part of the line display process is the Horizontal Blank. In detail, the Horizontal blanking interval consists of:
  - front porch -- blank while still moving right, past the end of the scanline,
  - sync pulse -- blank while rapidly moving left; in terms of amplitude, "blacker than black".
  - back porch -- blank while moving right again, before the start of the next scanline. Colorburst occurs during the back porch, and unblanking happens at the end of the back porch.

- fast (v.):
  - "abstain from food," Old English fæstan "to fast" (as a religious duty), also "to make firm; establish, confirm, pledge," from Proto-Germanic *fastanan "to hold, guard," extended to the religious act "observe abstinence" (source also of Old Frisian festia, Old High German fasten, German fasten, Old Norse fasta "abstain from food"), from the same root as fast (adj.). The original meaning in prehistoric Germanic was "hold firmly," and the sense evolved via "have firm control of oneself," to "hold oneself to observance" (compare Gothic fastan "to keep, observe," also "to fast"). Perhaps the Germanic sense shifted through use of the native words to translate Medieval Latin observare in its sense "to fast," or it might have been a loan-translation of a Greek expression brought to the Goths by Arian missionaries and spread from them to other Germanic peoples. The verb in the sense "to make fast" continued in Middle English, but was superseded by fasten.

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better][Worse is better]] is a term conceived by Richard P. Gabriel in an essay of the same name to describe the dynamics of software acceptance. It refers to the argument that software quality does not necessarily increase with functionality: that there is a point where less functionality ("worse") is a preferable option ("better") in terms of practicality and usability. Software that is limited, but simple to use, may be more appealing to the user and market than the reverse.

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Vostok][Lake Vostok]] is the largest of Antarctica's almost 400 known subglacial lakes. The overlying ice provides a continuous paleoclimatic record of 400,000 years, although the lake water itself may have been isolated for 15 to 25 million years. It is hypothesized that unusual forms of life could be found in the lake's liquid layer, a fossil water reserve. Because Lake Vostok may contain an environment sealed off below the ice for millions of years, the conditions could resemble those of ice-covered oceans hypothesized to exist on Jupiter's moon Europa, and Saturn's moon Enceladus.

Despite its name, the main result claimed by the bill is a method to square the circle, although it does imply various incorrect values of the mathematical constant π, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. The bill, written by a physician who was an amateur mathematician, never became law due to the intervention of Professor C. A.

Sarcoplasmic muscle locks in energy resources (glucose, creatine, etc) between the muscle layers, so looks a bit 'bigger' comparative to strength, i.e. the extra layers created by the resources between muscle layers helps bulk it out, and look a bit bigger. Myofibrillar muscle will have more layers of muscle over any given area when compared to sarcoplasmic muscle. So it will be able to lift more per lb or kg of muscle, but will run out of energy more quickly.

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_rebinding][DNS rebinding]] is an attack where a malicious web page causes visitors to run a client-side script that attacks machines elsewhere on the network.
  - The attacker registers a domain (such as attacker.com) and delegates it to a DNS server that is under the attacker's control. The server is configured to respond with a very short time to live (TTL) record, preventing the DNS response from being cached. When the victim browses to the malicious domain, the attacker's DNS server first responds with the IP address of a server hosting the malicious client-side code. For instance, they could point the victim's browser to a website that contains malicious JavaScript or Flash scripts that are intended to execute on the victim's computer. The malicious client-side code makes additional accesses to the original domain name (such as attacker.com). These are permitted by the same-origin policy. However, when the victim's browser runs the script it makes a new DNS request for the domain, and the attacker replies with a new IP address. For instance, they could reply with an internal IP address or the IP address of a target somewhere else on the Internet.

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptovirology][Cryptovirology]] is a field that studies how to use cryptography to design powerful malicious software. The field was born with the observation that public-key cryptography can be used to break the symmetry between what an antivirus analyst sees regarding malware and what the attacker sees. The antivirus analyst sees a public key contained in the malware, whereas the attacker sees the public key contained in the malware as well as the corresponding private key (outside the malware) since the attacker created the key pair for the attack. The public key allows the malware to perform trapdoor one-way operations on the victim's computer that only the attacker can undo.

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Brassau][Pierre Brassau]] was a chimpanzee and the subject of a 1964 hoax perpetrated by Åke "Dacke" Axelsson, a journalist at the Swedish tabloid Göteborgs-Tidningen. Axelsson came up with the idea of exhibiting a series of paintings made by a non-human primate, under the pretense that they were the work of a previously unknown French artist named "Pierre Brassau", in order to test whether critics could tell the difference between true avant-garde modern art and the work of a chimpanzee.
  - While one critic observed that "only an ape could have done this", most praised the works. Rolf Anderberg of the Göteborgs-Posten wrote, "Brassau paints with powerful strokes, but also with clear determination. His brush strokes twist with furious fastidiousness. Pierre is an artist who performs with the delicacy of a ballet dancer." After the hoax was revealed, Anderberg insisted that Peter's work was "still the best painting in the exhibition".

- Why are even numbered pages only ever on the left side of a book?
  - 

    #+begin_quote
    Each of the bound leaves of paper in a book is known in publishing as a folio.

    #+end_quote

  - 

    #+begin_quote
    The front side of a folio, or the "first" side which faces you, is known as the recto. Recto comes from the Latin for "right"and is a shortened form of rectō foliō or "right hand page". It also has the adverbial sense of "on the right hand side".

    #+end_quote

  - 

    #+begin_quote
    Hence the publishing convention that the recto or first page of a bound book is numbered "1" and is normally the right hand page.

    #+end_quote

  - 

    #+begin_quote
    The reverse side of a folio is the verso. This comes from the Latin vertĕre, "to turn", and refers to the side of the folio which faces you once it is turned. This second side is numbered "2" and is conventionally (and logically) a left-hand page.

This is because originally, you have a 2/3 chance of picking a goat. If the door you choose has a goat, and Monty reveals the goat in the 3rd door, then the car must be behind the door you didn't choose. Thus you should switch because you /know/ where the car is. 1/3 of the time, you pick the door with the car. When you switch, you switch to the door with another goat. But, this only happens 1/3 of the time, so it's to your advantage to switch every time, because you most likely picked the goat the first time.

- The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interesting_number_paradox][Interesting Number Paradox]] states that if you were to categorize numbers as "interesting" and "uninteresting", then of the set of "uninteresting" numbers, the smallest number would be an interesting number (as it is the smallest uninteresting number).

*** Thu May 21
- I learned that [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frog#Digestion_and_excretion][frogs have teeth]], although they are very weak and are only used to hold food (not chew or bite prey). On the other hand, toads don't have any teeth.

- The movie [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0286499/][Bend It Like Beckham]] was the first Western movie to be shown in North Korea.
- I also learned some more words from my crosswords that I've been doing:
  - *Peal*: a loud, prolonged ringing of bells
  - *Ply*: to carry on, practice, or pursue busily or steadily
  - *Denude*: to make bare
- As far as we know [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_monopole][magnetic monopoles]] do not exist. Whenever you break a magnet down, it will always have a "north" and "south" pole, no matter how small it is. This is in contrast to electric charges, where you can have something that is wholly positively or negatively charged.

*** Tue May 19
- I was doing some crosswords and learned these words:
  - *Abase*: to lower in rank, prestige or esteem
  - *Bung*: to close with a stopper
  - *Impel*: drive, force or urge to do something
  - *Prig*: self-righteous moralistic person
  - *Rector*: clergy who is in charge of a parish in the Episcopal church
- I also learned that [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiles%27s_proof_of_Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem][Andrew Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem]] was a proof by contradiction. He basically showed that if it was not true, then that would imply that a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity_theorem][proven theorem about elliptic curves]] would be false.
