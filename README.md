# Today I Learned

## May 2020

### Wed May 27
- More definitions:
  - **Abbot** - a man who is the head of an abbey of monks
  - **Catarrh** - excessive discharge or buildup of mucus in the nose or throat, associated with inflammation of the mucous membrane. Gross.
  - **Genial** - friendly and cheerful
  - **Impinge** - have an effect or impact, especially a negative one.

### Tue May 26
- 57 is often called "[Groethendieck's prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/57_(number)#In_mathematics)" after a story in which mathematician Alexander Grothendieck supposedly gave it as an example of a particular prime number.
- A [repdigit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repdigit) (or monodigit) is a number that is made of a single number repeated multiple times
  - A [repunit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repunit) is a repdigit that uses only 1s
  - A [Brazilian number] is a number that can be written as a repdigit in some base, not allowing the repdigit 11.
- A [Mersenne prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_prime) is a prime number that is one less that a power of two (and therefore can be represented by all 1s in binary)

### Mon May 25
- If you accidentally make/write in a file in `vim` without sudo, you can write the changes as sudo anyways by using `:w !sudo tee %`

### Sun May 24
- I learned more words from my crosswords:
  - **Assent**: the expression of approval or agreement
  - **Bivouac**: a temporary camp without tents or cover, used especially by soldiers or mountaineers
  - **Lariat**: rope
  - **Pall**: become less appealing or interesting through familiarity
- [Nothing-up-my-sleeve numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing-up-my-sleeve_number) are numbers (in cryptography) that are above suspicion of hidden properties, based on how they are chosed or constructed.
- The "tropical" in [tropical geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_geometry) because the person who first wrote on it was from Brazil.
- The en-dash (–) is the same width as a capital N, and is used to separate items in a list. The em-dash (—) is the same width as a capital M, and is used to signal a separate but related clause.

### Sat May 23
- The green stuff you eat in sushi restaurants is probably not real wasabi (it's more likely [a combination of horseradish, mustard, and green food coloring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasabi#Surrogates)). Real wasabi is very expensive because it only grows by fresh mountain streams in Japan. It requires rocky soil, constant fresh water, and has to be kept at a certain temperature. It then has to be harvested by hand, and when it is grated, it only retains it's flavor for ~30 minutes.
- Along with the classic "Alice" and "Bob" placeholders used in cryptography as placeholders for the names of different communicating parties, there is a whole [cast of characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob#Cast_of_characters).
- Similarly, there are more variable names similar to "foo" and "bar", including [baz, qux, quux, quuz, corge, grault, garply, waldo, fred, plugh, xyzzy, and thud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasyntactic_variable).
  - Most notably, in Python (which is named after [Monty Python, not the snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)#Naming)), the common variable placeholders are "spam" "ham" and "eggs" (from Monty Python's "Spam" sketch).

### Fri May 22
- [Add-Rotate-XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher#ARX_(add%E2%80%93rotate%E2%80%93XOR)) algorithms (for cryptographic schemes) are popular because all of those functions run in constant time, and are therefore immune to timing attacks.
- The [Interesting Number Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interesting_number_paradox) states that if you were to categorize numbers as "interesting" and "uninteresting", then of the set of "uninteresting" numbers, the smallest number would be an interesting number (as it is the smallest uninteresting number).

### Thu May 21
- I learned that [frogs have teeth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frog#Digestion_and_excretion), although they are very weak and are only used to hold food (not chew or bite prey). On the other hand, toads don't have any teeth.

### Wed May 20
- The movie [Bend It Like Beckham](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0286499/) was the first Western movie to be shown in North Korea.
- I also learned some more words from my crosswords that I've been doing:
  - **Peal**: a loud, prolonged ringing of bells
  - **Ply**: to carry on, practice, or pursue busily or steadily
  - **Denude**: to make bare
- As far as we know [magnetic monopoles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_monopole) do not exist. Whenever you break a magnet down, it will always have a "north" and "south" pole, no matter how small it is. This is in contrast to electric charges, where you can have something that is wholly positively or negatively charged.

### Tue May 19
- I was doing some crosswords and learned these words:
  - **Abase**: to lower in rank, prestige or esteem
  - **Bung**: to close with a stopper
  - **Impel**: drive, force or urge to do something
  - **Prig**: self-righteous moralistic person
  - **Rector**: clergy who is in charge of a parish in the Episcopal church
- I also learned that [Andrew Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiles%27s_proof_of_Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem) was a proof by contradiction. He basically showed that if it was not true, then that would imply that a [proven theorem about elliptic curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity_theorem) would be false.
