- [DNS rebinding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_rebinding) is an attack where a malicious web page causes visitors to run a client-side script that attacks machines elsewhere on the network.
  - The attacker registers a domain (such as attacker.com) and delegates it to a DNS server that is under the attacker's control. The server is configured to respond with a very short time to live (TTL) record, preventing the DNS response from being cached. When the victim browses to the malicious domain, the attacker's DNS server first responds with the IP address of a server hosting the malicious client-side code. For instance, they could point the victim's browser to a website that contains malicious JavaScript or Flash scripts that are intended to execute on the victim's computer. The malicious client-side code makes additional accesses to the original domain name (such as attacker.com). These are permitted by the same-origin policy. However, when the victim's browser runs the script it makes a new DNS request for the domain, and the attacker replies with a new IP address. For instance, they could reply with an internal IP address or the IP address of a target somewhere else on the Internet.

- [Conservation-induced extinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation-induced_extinction) can happen when trying to preserve a different species. This mostly threatens the parasite and pathogen species that are highly host-specific to critically endangered hosts. When the last individuals of a host species are captured for the purpose of captive breeding and reintroduction programs, they typically undergo anti-parasitic treatments to increase survival and reproductive success. This practice may unintentionally result in the extinction of the species antagonistic to the target species, such as certain parasites.

### Sun Nov 7
- [Cryptovirology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptovirology) is a field that studies how to use cryptography to design powerful malicious software. The field was born with the observation that public-key cryptography can be used to break the symmetry between what an antivirus analyst sees regarding malware and what the attacker sees. The antivirus analyst sees a public key contained in the malware, whereas the attacker sees the public key contained in the malware as well as the corresponding private key (outside the malware) since the attacker created the key pair for the attack. The public key allows the malware to perform trapdoor one-way operations on the victim's computer that only the attacker can undo.

### Sat Nov 6
- The term "closed" (versus "open") in "closed captions" indicates that the captions are not visible until activated by the viewer, usually via the remote control or menu option. On the other hand, "open", "burned-in", "baked on", "hard-coded", or simply "hard" captions are visible to all viewers as they are embedded in the video.
  - [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_captioning)
- The United Kingdom, Ireland, and most other countries do not distinguish between subtitles and closed captions and use "subtitles" as the general term. The equivalent of "captioning" is usually referred to as "subtitles for the hard of hearing". Their presence is referenced on screen by notation which says "Subtitles", or previously "Subtitles 888" or just "888" (the latter two are in reference to the conventional videotext channel for captions), which is why the term subtitle is also used to refer to the Ceefax-based videotext encoding that is used with PAL-compatible video.

- [Pierre Brassau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Brassau) was a chimpanzee and the subject of a 1964 hoax perpetrated by Åke "Dacke" Axelsson, a journalist at the Swedish tabloid Göteborgs-Tidningen. Axelsson came up with the idea of exhibiting a series of paintings made by a non-human primate, under the pretense that they were the work of a previously unknown French artist named "Pierre Brassau", in order to test whether critics could tell the difference between true avant-garde modern art and the work of a chimpanzee.
  - While one critic observed that "only an ape could have done this", most praised the works. Rolf Anderberg of the Göteborgs-Posten wrote, "Brassau paints with powerful strokes, but also with clear determination. His brush strokes twist with furious fastidiousness. Pierre is an artist who performs with the delicacy of a ballet dancer." After the hoax was revealed, Anderberg insisted that Peter's work was "still the best painting in the exhibition".

- Why are even numbered pages only ever on the left side of a book?
  - > Each of the bound leaves of paper in a book is known in publishing as a folio.
  - > The front side of a folio, or the "first" side which faces you, is known as the recto. Recto comes from the Latin for "right"and is a shortened form of rectō foliō or "right hand page". It also has the adverbial sense of "on the right hand side".
  - > Hence the publishing convention that the recto or first page of a bound book is numbered "1" and is normally the right hand page.
  - > The reverse side of a folio is the verso. This comes from the Latin vertĕre, "to turn", and refers to the side of the folio which faces you once it is turned. This second side is numbered "2" and is conventionally (and logically) a left-hand page.

### Sat Sep 26
- The reason that the [Monty Hall problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) gives you a 2/3 chance of being correct when you switch doors doesn't have much to do with the door being revealed - assuming your switch, your probability is already set when you pick your first door. This is because originally, you have a 2/3 chance of picking a goat. If the door you choose has a goat, and Monty reveals the goat in the 3rd door, then the car must be behind the door you didn't choose. Thus you should switch because you *know* where the car is. 1/3 of the time, you pick the door with the car. When you switch, you switch to the door with another goat. But, this only happens 1/3 of the time, so it's to your advantage to switch every time, because you most likely picked the goat the first time.

### Mon June 15
- I was wondering how seedless watermelons are grown since the desired fruit that you'd want to make more of, ya know, has no seeds. This is how they do it:
  > By contrast, seedless watermelons are grown from seeds. These seeds are produced by crossing diploid and tetraploid lines of watermelon, with the resulting seeds producing sterile triploid plants. Fruit development is triggered by pollination, so these plants must be grown alongside a diploid strain to provide pollen.

Warhol would simply film them, and declare them "superstars".

### Tue June 2
- While reading some articles about .package manager security, I learned that `npm` does not require the code in your published package to match the code in your git repo. In fact, `npm` doesn't require you to have a public mirror of your code at all.
- I learned the difference between a package and a module in `npm`. The `npm` registry contains packages, many of which are also Node modules, or contain Node modules.
  - **Packages**: A package is a file or directory that is described by a package.json file
    - a) A folder containing a program described by a package.json file.
    - b) A gzipped tarball containing (a).
    - c) A URL that resolves to (b).
    - d) A <name>@<version> that is published on the registry with (c).
    - e) A <name>@<tag> that points to (d).
    - f) A <name> that has a latest tag satisfying (e).
    - g) A git url that, when cloned, results in (a).
  - **Modules**: A module is any file or directory in the node_modules directory that can be loaded by the Node.js require() function.

### Sat May 23
- The green stuff you eat in sushi restaurants is probably not real wasabi (it's more likely [a combination of horseradish, mustard, and green food coloring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasabi#Surrogates)). Real wasabi is very expensive because it only grows by fresh mountain streams in Japan. It requires rocky soil, constant fresh water, and has to be kept at a certain temperature. It then has to be harvested by hand, and when it is grated, it only retains it's flavor for ~30 minutes.
- Along with the classic "Alice" and "Bob" placeholders used in cryptography as placeholders for the names of different communicating parties, there is a whole [cast of characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob#Cast_of_characters).
- Similarly, there are more variable names similar to "foo" and "bar", including [baz, qux, quux, quuz, corge, grault, garply, waldo, fred, plugh, xyzzy, and thud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasyntactic_variable).
  - Most notably, in Python (which is named after [Monty Python, not the snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)#Naming)), the common variable placeholders are "spam" "ham" and "eggs" (from Monty Python's "Spam" sketch).

### Fri May 22
- [Add-Rotate-XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher#ARX_(add%E2%80%93rotate%E2%80%93XOR)) algorithms (for cryptographic schemes) are popular because all of those functions run in constant time, and are therefore immune to timing attacks.
- The [Interesting Number Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interesting_number_paradox) states that if you were to categorize numbers as "interesting" and "uninteresting", then of the set of "uninteresting" numbers, the smallest number would be an interesting number (as it is the smallest uninteresting number).

### Thu May 21
- I learned that [frogs have teeth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frog#Digestion_and_excretion), although they are very weak and are only used to hold food (not chew or bite prey). On the other hand, toads don't have any teeth.

### Wed May 20

- As far as we know [magnetic monopoles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_monopole) do not exist. Whenever you break a magnet down, it will always have a "north" and "south" pole, no matter how small it is. This is in contrast to electric charges, where you can have something that is wholly positively or negatively charged.
