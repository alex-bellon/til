# Today I Learned

## May 2020

### Thu May 21
- I learned that [frogs have teeth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frog#Digestion_and_excretion), although they are very weak and are only used to hold food (not chew or bite prey). On the other hand, toads don't have any teeth.

### Wed May 20
- The movie [Bend It Like Beckham](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0286499/) was the first Western movie to be shown in North Korea.

- I also learned some more words from my crosswords that I've been doing:
  - **Peal**: a loud, prolonged ringing of bells
  - **Ply**: to carry on, practice, or pursue busily or steadily
  - **Denude**: to make bare

- As far as we know [magnetic monopoles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_monopole) do not exist. Whenever you break a magnet down, it will always have a "north" and "south" pole, no matter how small it is. This is in contrast to electric charges, where you can have something that is wholly positively or negatively charged.

### Tue May 19
- I was doing some crosswords and learned these words:
  - **Abase**: to lower in rank, prestige or esteem
  - **Bung**: to close with a stopper
  - **Impel**: drive, force or urge to do something
  - **Prig**: self-righteous moralistic person
  - **Rector**: clergy who is in charge of a parish in the Episcopal church

- I also learned that [Andrew Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiles%27s_proof_of_Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem) was a proof by contradiction. He basically showed that if it was not true, then that would imply that a [proven theorem about elliptic curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity_theorem) would be false.
