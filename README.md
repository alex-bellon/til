# Today I Learned


## November 2021

### Sun Nov 7
- [Cryptovirology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptovirology) is a field that studies how to use cryptography to design powerful malicious software. The field was born with the observation that public-key cryptography can be used to break the symmetry between what an antivirus analyst sees regarding malware and what the attacker sees. The antivirus analyst sees a public key contained in the malware, whereas the attacker sees the public key contained in the malware as well as the corresponding private key (outside the malware) since the attacker created the key pair for the attack. The public key allows the malware to perform trapdoor one-way operations on the victim's computer that only the attacker can undo. 

### Sat Nov 6
- The term "closed" (versus "open") in "closed captions" indicates that the captions are not visible until activated by the viewer, usually via the remote control or menu option. On the other hand, "open", "burned-in", "baked on", "hard-coded", or simply "hard" captions are visible to all viewers as they are embedded in the video. 
  - [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_captioning)
- The United Kingdom, Ireland, and most other countries do not distinguish between subtitles and closed captions and use "subtitles" as the general term. The equivalent of "captioning" is usually referred to as "subtitles for the hard of hearing". Their presence is referenced on screen by notation which says "Subtitles", or previously "Subtitles 888" or just "888" (the latter two are in reference to the conventional videotext channel for captions), which is why the term subtitle is also used to refer to the Ceefax-based videotext encoding that is used with PAL-compatible video. 

### Fri Nov 5
- [Eroom's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eroom%27s_law) is the observation that drug discovery is becoming slower and more expensive over time, despite improvements in technology (such as high-throughput screening, biotechnology, combinatorial chemistry, and computational drug design), a trend first observed in the 1980s

- [Pierre Brassau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Brassau) was a chimpanzee and the subject of a 1964 hoax perpetrated by Åke "Dacke" Axelsson, a journalist at the Swedish tabloid Göteborgs-Tidningen. Axelsson came up with the idea of exhibiting a series of paintings made by a non-human primate, under the pretense that they were the work of a previously unknown French artist named "Pierre Brassau", in order to test whether critics could tell the difference between true avant-garde modern art and the work of a chimpanzee.
  - While one critic observed that "only an ape could have done this", most praised the works. Rolf Anderberg of the Göteborgs-Posten wrote, "Brassau paints with powerful strokes, but also with clear determination. His brush strokes twist with furious fastidiousness. Pierre is an artist who performs with the delicacy of a ballet dancer." After the hoax was revealed, Anderberg insisted that Peter's work was "still the best painting in the exhibition". 
- A [cat organ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_organ) is a hypothetical musical instrument which consists of a line of cats fixed in place with their tails stretched out underneath a keyboard so that they cry out when a key is pressed.

- Why are even numbered pages only ever on the left side of a book?
  - > Each of the bound leaves of paper in a book is known in publishing as a folio.
  - > The front side of a folio, or the "first" side which faces you, is known as the recto. Recto comes from the Latin for "right"and is a shortened form of rectō foliō or "right hand page". It also has the adverbial sense of "on the right hand side".
  - > Hence the publishing convention that the recto or first page of a bound book is numbered "1" and is normally the right hand page.
  - > The reverse side of a folio is the verso. This comes from the Latin vertĕre, "to turn", and refers to the side of the folio which faces you once it is turned. This second side is numbered "2" and is conventionally (and logically) a left-hand page.

### Sat Sep 26
- The reason that the [Monty Hall problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) gives you a 2/3 chance of being correct when you switch doors doesn't have much to do with the door being revealed - assuming your switch, your probability is already set when you pick your first door. This is because originally, you have a 2/3 chance of picking a goat. If the door you choose has a goat, and Monty reveals the goat in the 3rd door, then the car must be behind the door you didn't choose. Thus you should switch because you *know* where the car is. 1/3 of the time, you pick the door with the car. When you switch, you switch to the door with another goat. But, this only happens 1/3 of the time, so it's to your advantage to switch every time, because you most likely picked the goat the first time.

### Mon June 15
- I was wondering how seedless watermelons are grown since the desired fruit that you'd want to make more of, ya know, has no seeds. This is how they do it:
  > By contrast, seedless watermelons are grown from seeds. These seeds are produced by crossing diploid and tetraploid lines of watermelon, with the resulting seeds producing sterile triploid plants. Fruit development is triggered by pollination, so these plants must be grown alongside a diploid strain to provide pollen.

### Sun June 14
- The word "con-man" comes from [confidence trick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick), which is an attempt to defraud a person or group after first gaining their trust. So basically, what a con-man does.

### Thu June 11
- **Consternate**: Fill with anxiety
- Not really "learning", but I finished the book [Countdown to Zero Day](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/219931/countdown-to-zero-day-by-kim-zetter/) and started [The Design of Everyday Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things). Honestly I didn't really like Countdown to Zero Day, as I was expecting more technical/security content than there actually was, and the book kind of dragged on with not-very-relevant details (in my opinion).

### Wed June 10
- [Cement is actually an ingredient in concrete](https://www.ccagc.org/resources/whats-the-difference-between-cement-and-concrete/). Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time.

- Jelly vs. Jam vs. Preserves:
  - In **jelly**, the fruit comes in the form of fruit juice. Jelly has the smoothest consistency and is usually clear.
  - In **jam**, the fruit comes in the form of fruit pulp or crushed fruit. This makes jam less stiff than jelly.
  - In **preserves**, the fruit comes in the form of chunks in a gel or syrup. Preserves will have more fruit in them than jam will. Marmalade is a type of preserve with citrus fruits in it.

### Mon June 8
- [Proper left/right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_right_and_proper_left) refer to the left/right of a figure or person being described. If you were looking at a statue, their right hand would be "proper right" despite which side it appeared to be on to you.

### Wed June 3
- [Schaefer's Dichotomy Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schaefer%27s_dichotomy_theorem) states that there are 6 classes of SAT problems that are in P, while all of the rest are NP-complete. The 6 classes are
  - all relations which are not constantly false are true when all its arguments are true;
  - all relations which are not constantly false are true when all its arguments are false;
  - all relations are equivalent to a conjunction of binary clauses;
  - all relations are equivalent to a conjunction of Horn clauses;
  - all relations are equivalent to a conjunction of dual-Horn clauses;
  - all relations are equivalent to a conjunction of affine formulae.
- [Warhol superstars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhol_superstars) were a clique of New York City personalities promoted by the pop artist Andy Warhol during the 1960s and early 1970s. These personalities appeared in Warhol's artworks and accompanied him in his social life, epitomizing his famous dictum, "In the future everyone will be famous for fifteen minutes". Warhol would simply film them, and declare them "superstars".

### Tue June 2
- While reading some articles about .package manager security, I learned that `npm` does not require the code in your published package to match the code in your git repo. In fact, `npm` doesn't require you to have a public mirror of your code at all.
- I learned the difference between a package and a module in `npm`. The `npm` registry contains packages, many of which are also Node modules, or contain Node modules.
  - **Packages**: A package is a file or directory that is described by a package.json file
    - a) A folder containing a program described by a package.json file.
    - b) A gzipped tarball containing (a).
    - c) A URL that resolves to (b).
    - d) A <name>@<version> that is published on the registry with (c).
    - e) A <name>@<tag> that points to (d).
    - f) A <name> that has a latest tag satisfying (e).
    - g) A git url that, when cloned, results in (a).
  - **Modules**: A module is any file or directory in the node_modules directory that can be loaded by the Node.js require() function.
    - A folder with a package.json file containing a "main" field.
    - A folder with an index.js file in it.
    - A JavaScript file.

### Mon June 1
- I learned about [SemVer](https://semver.org/) (Semantic Versioning), which is a standard for numbering package versions
  - Given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, increment the:
    - `MAJOR` version when you make incompatible API changes,
    - `MINOR` version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
    - `PATCH` version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

  - It has 3 different levels:
    - GREEN: full menu – restaurant has power and damage is limited or no damage at all.
    - YELLOW: limited menu – no power or only power from a generator, or food supplies may be low.
    - RED: the restaurant is closed – indicating severe damage or severe flooding.

### Thu May 28
- The difference between a logomark and a logotype is that logomarks do not have any words in them (think the Twitter bird, the Apple apple) while a logotype is made of stylized words (think Coca Cola). A "logo" could refer to either, both, or a combination of the two.

### Tue May 26
- 57 is often called "[Groethendieck's prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/57_(number)#In_mathematics)" after a story in which mathematician Alexander Grothendieck supposedly gave it as an example of a particular prime number.
- A [repdigit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repdigit) (or monodigit) is a number that is made of a single number repeated multiple times
  - A [repunit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repunit) is a repdigit that uses only 1s
  - A [Brazilian number] is a number that can be written as a repdigit in some base, not allowing the repdigit 11.
- A [Mersenne prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_prime) is a prime number that is one less that a power of two (and therefore can be represented by all 1s in binary)

### Mon May 25
- If you accidentally make/write in a file in `vim` without sudo, you can write the changes as sudo anyways by using `:w !sudo tee %`

  - **Assent**: the expression of approval or agreement
  - **Bivouac**: a temporary camp without tents or cover, used especially by soldiers or mountaineers
  - **Lariat**: rope
  - **Pall**: become less appealing or interesting through familiarity
- [Nothing-up-my-sleeve numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing-up-my-sleeve_number) are numbers (in cryptography) that are above suspicion of hidden properties, based on how they are chosed or constructed.
- The "tropical" in [tropical geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_geometry) because the person who first wrote on it was from Brazil.
- The en-dash (–) is the same width as a capital N, and is used to separate items in a list. The em-dash (—) is the same width as a capital M, and is used to signal a separate but related clause.

### Sat May 23
- The green stuff you eat in sushi restaurants is probably not real wasabi (it's more likely [a combination of horseradish, mustard, and green food coloring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasabi#Surrogates)). Real wasabi is very expensive because it only grows by fresh mountain streams in Japan. It requires rocky soil, constant fresh water, and has to be kept at a certain temperature. It then has to be harvested by hand, and when it is grated, it only retains it's flavor for ~30 minutes.
- Along with the classic "Alice" and "Bob" placeholders used in cryptography as placeholders for the names of different communicating parties, there is a whole [cast of characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob#Cast_of_characters).
- Similarly, there are more variable names similar to "foo" and "bar", including [baz, qux, quux, quuz, corge, grault, garply, waldo, fred, plugh, xyzzy, and thud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasyntactic_variable).
  - Most notably, in Python (which is named after [Monty Python, not the snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)#Naming)), the common variable placeholders are "spam" "ham" and "eggs" (from Monty Python's "Spam" sketch).

### Fri May 22
- [Add-Rotate-XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher#ARX_(add%E2%80%93rotate%E2%80%93XOR)) algorithms (for cryptographic schemes) are popular because all of those functions run in constant time, and are therefore immune to timing attacks.
- The [Interesting Number Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interesting_number_paradox) states that if you were to categorize numbers as "interesting" and "uninteresting", then of the set of "uninteresting" numbers, the smallest number would be an interesting number (as it is the smallest uninteresting number).

### Thu May 21
- I learned that [frogs have teeth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frog#Digestion_and_excretion), although they are very weak and are only used to hold food (not chew or bite prey). On the other hand, toads don't have any teeth.

### Wed May 20
- The movie [Bend It Like Beckham](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0286499/) was the first Western movie to be shown in North Korea.

  - **Peal**: a loud, prolonged ringing of bells
  - **Ply**: to carry on, practice, or pursue busily or steadily
  - **Denude**: to make bare
- As far as we know [magnetic monopoles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_monopole) do not exist. Whenever you break a magnet down, it will always have a "north" and "south" pole, no matter how small it is. This is in contrast to electric charges, where you can have something that is wholly positively or negatively charged.

### Tue May 19

  - **Abase**: to lower in rank, prestige or esteem
  - **Bung**: to close with a stopper
  - **Impel**: drive, force or urge to do something
  - **Prig**: self-righteous moralistic person
  - **Rector**: clergy who is in charge of a parish in the Episcopal church
- I also learned that [Andrew Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiles%27s_proof_of_Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem) was a proof by contradiction. He basically showed that if it was not true, then that would imply that a [proven theorem about elliptic curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity_theorem) would be false.
