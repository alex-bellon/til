# Today I Learned

## May 2020

### Tue May 19
I was doing some crosswords and learned these words:
- **Abase**: to lower in rank, prestige or esteem
- **Bung**: to close with a stopper
- **Impel**: drive, force or urge to do something
- **Prig**: self-righteous moralistic person
- **Rector**: clergy who is in charge of a parish in the Episcopal church

I also learned that [Andrew Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiles%27s_proof_of_Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem) was a proof by contradiction. He basically showed that if it was not true, then that would imply that a [proven theorem about elliptic curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity_theorem) would be false. Kind of a power move if you ask me.
