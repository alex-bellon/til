### Sat Sep 26
- The reason that the [Monty Hall problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) gives you a 2/3 chance of being correct when you switch doors doesn't have much to do with the door being revealed - assuming your switch, your probability is already set when you pick your first door. This is because originally, you have a 2/3 chance of picking a goat. If the door you choose has a goat, and Monty reveals the goat in the 3rd door, then the car must be behind the door you didn't choose. Thus you should switch because you *know* where the car is. 1/3 of the time, you pick the door with the car. When you switch, you switch to the door with another goat. But, this only happens 1/3 of the time, so it's to your advantage to switch every time, because you most likely picked the goat the first time.

  > By contrast, seedless watermelons are grown from seeds. These seeds are produced by crossing diploid and tetraploid lines of watermelon, with the resulting seeds producing sterile triploid plants. Fruit development is triggered by pollination, so these plants must be grown alongside a diploid strain to provide pollen.

### Tue June 2
- While reading some articles about .package manager security, I learned that `npm` does not require the code in your published package to match the code in your git repo. In fact, `npm` doesn't require you to have a public mirror of your code at all.
- I learned the difference between a package and a module in `npm`. The `npm` registry contains packages, many of which are also Node modules, or contain Node modules.

    - a) A folder containing a program described by a package.json file.
    - b) A gzipped tarball containing (a).
    - c) A URL that resolves to (b).
    - d) A <name>@<version> that is published on the registry with (c).
    - e) A <name>@<tag> that points to (d).
    - f) A <name> that has a latest tag satisfying (e).

### Sat May 23
- The green stuff you eat in sushi restaurants is probably not real wasabi (it's more likely [a combination of horseradish, mustard, and green food coloring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasabi#Surrogates)). Real wasabi is very expensive because it only grows by fresh mountain streams in Japan. It requires rocky soil, constant fresh water, and has to be kept at a certain temperature. It then has to be harvested by hand, and when it is grated, it only retains it's flavor for ~30 minutes.
- Along with the classic "Alice" and "Bob" placeholders used in cryptography as placeholders for the names of different communicating parties, there is a whole [cast of characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob#Cast_of_characters).
- Similarly, there are more variable names similar to "foo" and "bar", including [baz, qux, quux, quuz, corge, grault, garply, waldo, fred, plugh, xyzzy, and thud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasyntactic_variable).
  - Most notably, in Python (which is named after [Monty Python, not the snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)#Naming)), the common variable placeholders are "spam" "ham" and "eggs" (from Monty Python's "Spam" sketch).

### Fri May 22
- [Add-Rotate-XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher#ARX_(add%E2%80%93rotate%E2%80%93XOR)) algorithms (for cryptographic schemes) are popular because all of those functions run in constant time, and are therefore immune to timing attacks.
- The [Interesting Number Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interesting_number_paradox) states that if you were to categorize numbers as "interesting" and "uninteresting", then of the set of "uninteresting" numbers, the smallest number would be an interesting number (as it is the smallest uninteresting number).

### Thu May 21
- I learned that [frogs have teeth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frog#Digestion_and_excretion), although they are very weak and are only used to hold food (not chew or bite prey). On the other hand, toads don't have any teeth.

Whenever you break a magnet down, it will always have a "north" and "south" pole, no matter how small it is. This is in contrast to electric charges, where you can have something that is wholly positively or negatively charged.

### Tue May 19

He basically showed that if it was not true, then that would imply that a [proven theorem about elliptic curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity_theorem) would be false.
