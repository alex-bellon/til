# Today I Learned

## June 2020

### Fri June 12
- [Symlinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link) work with Git! For some reason I assumed they didn't and never bothered to check. I will be spending my weekend combining a lot of files across my different repos :)

### Thu June 11
- **Consternate**: Fill with anxiety
- Not really "learning", but I finished the book [Countdown to Zero Day](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/219931/countdown-to-zero-day-by-kim-zetter/) and started [The Design of Everyday Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things). Honestly I didn't really like Countdown to Zero Day, as I was expecting more technical/security content than there actually was, and the book kind of dragged on with not-very-relevant details (in my opinion).

### Wed June 10
- [Cement is actually an ingredient in concrete](https://www.ccagc.org/resources/whats-the-difference-between-cement-and-concrete/). Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time.

### Tue June 9
- Jelly vs. Jam vs. Preserves:
  - In **jelly**, the fruit comes in the form of fruit juice. Jelly has the smoothest consistency and is usually clear.
  - In **jam**, the fruit comes in the form of fruit pulp or crushed fruit. This makes jam less stiff than jelly.
  - In **preserves**, the fruit comes in the form of chunks in a gel or syrup. Preserves will have more fruit in them than jam will. Marmalade is a type of preserve with citrus fruits in it.

### Mon June 8
- [Proper left/right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_right_and_proper_left) refer to the left/right of a figure or person being described. If you were looking at a statue, their right hand would be "proper right" despite which side it appeared to be on to you.

### Sun June 7
- This character: `ˆ` is called a [circumflex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumflex)

### Sat June 6
- Differences between sea lions and seals
  - Noises: seals make a snorting noise, sea lions bark
  - Movement: seals scoot around, sea lions walk with their hind flippers
  - Ears: seals have small ear holes, sea lions have little ear flaps

### Fri June 5
- [Icelandic police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_Police) don't carry weapons (they are kept in their car) .The first (and only) time a person was shot and killed by Icelandic police in modern history was in 2013, when a man was firing a shotgun in his home and began shooting at the police.

### Thu June 4
- Both [tortoises](https://www.thetortoiseshop.com/basic-tortoise-anatomy-biology) and [turtles](http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Info/info.htm) can feel through their shells

### Wed June 3
- [Schaefer's Dichotomy Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schaefer%27s_dichotomy_theorem) states that there are 6 classes of SAT problems that are in P, while all of the rest are NP-complete. The 6 classes are
  - all relations which are not constantly false are true when all its arguments are true;
  - all relations which are not constantly false are true when all its arguments are false;
  - all relations are equivalent to a conjunction of binary clauses;
  - all relations are equivalent to a conjunction of Horn clauses;
  - all relations are equivalent to a conjunction of dual-Horn clauses;
  - all relations are equivalent to a conjunction of affine formulae.
- [Warhol superstars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhol_superstars) were a clique of New York City personalities promoted by the pop artist Andy Warhol during the 1960s and early 1970s. These personalities appeared in Warhol's artworks and accompanied him in his social life, epitomizing his famous dictum, "In the future everyone will be famous for fifteen minutes". Warhol would simply film them, and declare them "superstars".

### Tue June 2
- While reading some articles about .package manager security, I learned that `npm` does not require the code in your published package to match the code in your git repo. In fact, `npm` doesn't require you to have a public mirror of your code at all.
- I learned the difference between a package and a module in `npm`. The `npm` registry contains packages, many of which are also Node modules, or contain Node modules.
  - **Packages**: A package is a file or directory that is described by a package.json file
    - a) A folder containing a program described by a package.json file.
    - b) A gzipped tarball containing (a).
    - c) A URL that resolves to (b).
    - d) A <name>@<version> that is published on the registry with (c).
    - e) A <name>@<tag> that points to (d).
    - f) A <name> that has a latest tag satisfying (e).
    - g) A git url that, when cloned, results in (a).
  - **Modules**: A module is any file or directory in the node_modules directory that can be loaded by the Node.js require() function.
    - A folder with a package.json file containing a "main" field.
    - A folder with an index.js file in it.
    - A JavaScript file.

### Mon June 1
- I learned about [SemVer](https://semver.org/) (Semantic Versioning), which is a standard for numbering package versions
  - Given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, increment the:
    - `MAJOR` version when you make incompatible API changes,
    - `MINOR` version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
    - `PATCH` version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

## May 2020

### Sun May 31
- [Pink Capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_capitalism) is the incorporation of the LGBTQ+ movement as a way to capitalism and the market economy; using LGBTQ+ imagery for economic gain.
- Suffix alises in zsh allow you to launch files with a specific extension (or suffix) in your favorite tool. To register a suffix alias, use the `alias -s extension=name-of-the-tool` pattern.

### Sat May 30
- [Solo garlic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solo_garlic) is garlic that only has one clove despite being roughly the size of a normal head of garlic

### Fri May 29
- The [Waffle House Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waffle_House_Index) is an informal metric named after the Waffle House restaurant chain and is used by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to determine the effect of a storm and the likely scale of assistance required for disaster recovery.
  - It has 3 different levels:
    - GREEN: full menu – restaurant has power and damage is limited or no damage at all.
    - YELLOW: limited menu – no power or only power from a generator, or food supplies may be low.
    - RED: the restaurant is closed – indicating severe damage or severe flooding.

### Thu May 28
- The difference between a logomark and a logotype is that logomarks do not have any words in them (think the Twitter bird, the Apple apple) while a logotype is made of stylized words (think Coca Cola). A "logo" could refer to either, both, or a combination of the two.

### Wed May 27
- More definitions:
  - **Abbot** - a man who is the head of an abbey of monks
  - **Catarrh** - excessive discharge or buildup of mucus in the nose or throat, associated with inflammation of the mucous membrane. Gross.
  - **Genial** - friendly and cheerful
  - **Impinge** - have an effect or impact, especially a negative one.

### Tue May 26
- 57 is often called "[Groethendieck's prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/57_(number)#In_mathematics)" after a story in which mathematician Alexander Grothendieck supposedly gave it as an example of a particular prime number.
- A [repdigit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repdigit) (or monodigit) is a number that is made of a single number repeated multiple times
  - A [repunit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repunit) is a repdigit that uses only 1s
  - A [Brazilian number] is a number that can be written as a repdigit in some base, not allowing the repdigit 11.
- A [Mersenne prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_prime) is a prime number that is one less that a power of two (and therefore can be represented by all 1s in binary)

### Mon May 25
- If you accidentally make/write in a file in `vim` without sudo, you can write the changes as sudo anyways by using `:w !sudo tee %`

### Sun May 24
- I learned more words from my crosswords:
  - **Assent**: the expression of approval or agreement
  - **Bivouac**: a temporary camp without tents or cover, used especially by soldiers or mountaineers
  - **Lariat**: rope
  - **Pall**: become less appealing or interesting through familiarity
- [Nothing-up-my-sleeve numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing-up-my-sleeve_number) are numbers (in cryptography) that are above suspicion of hidden properties, based on how they are chosed or constructed.
- The "tropical" in [tropical geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_geometry) because the person who first wrote on it was from Brazil.
- The en-dash (–) is the same width as a capital N, and is used to separate items in a list. The em-dash (—) is the same width as a capital M, and is used to signal a separate but related clause.

### Sat May 23
- The green stuff you eat in sushi restaurants is probably not real wasabi (it's more likely [a combination of horseradish, mustard, and green food coloring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasabi#Surrogates)). Real wasabi is very expensive because it only grows by fresh mountain streams in Japan. It requires rocky soil, constant fresh water, and has to be kept at a certain temperature. It then has to be harvested by hand, and when it is grated, it only retains it's flavor for ~30 minutes.
- Along with the classic "Alice" and "Bob" placeholders used in cryptography as placeholders for the names of different communicating parties, there is a whole [cast of characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob#Cast_of_characters).
- Similarly, there are more variable names similar to "foo" and "bar", including [baz, qux, quux, quuz, corge, grault, garply, waldo, fred, plugh, xyzzy, and thud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasyntactic_variable).
  - Most notably, in Python (which is named after [Monty Python, not the snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)#Naming)), the common variable placeholders are "spam" "ham" and "eggs" (from Monty Python's "Spam" sketch).

### Fri May 22
- [Add-Rotate-XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher#ARX_(add%E2%80%93rotate%E2%80%93XOR)) algorithms (for cryptographic schemes) are popular because all of those functions run in constant time, and are therefore immune to timing attacks.
- The [Interesting Number Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interesting_number_paradox) states that if you were to categorize numbers as "interesting" and "uninteresting", then of the set of "uninteresting" numbers, the smallest number would be an interesting number (as it is the smallest uninteresting number).

### Thu May 21
- I learned that [frogs have teeth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frog#Digestion_and_excretion), although they are very weak and are only used to hold food (not chew or bite prey). On the other hand, toads don't have any teeth.

### Wed May 20
- The movie [Bend It Like Beckham](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0286499/) was the first Western movie to be shown in North Korea.
- I also learned some more words from my crosswords that I've been doing:
  - **Peal**: a loud, prolonged ringing of bells
  - **Ply**: to carry on, practice, or pursue busily or steadily
  - **Denude**: to make bare
- As far as we know [magnetic monopoles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_monopole) do not exist. Whenever you break a magnet down, it will always have a "north" and "south" pole, no matter how small it is. This is in contrast to electric charges, where you can have something that is wholly positively or negatively charged.

### Tue May 19
- I was doing some crosswords and learned these words:
  - **Abase**: to lower in rank, prestige or esteem
  - **Bung**: to close with a stopper
  - **Impel**: drive, force or urge to do something
  - **Prig**: self-righteous moralistic person
  - **Rector**: clergy who is in charge of a parish in the Episcopal church
- I also learned that [Andrew Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiles%27s_proof_of_Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem) was a proof by contradiction. He basically showed that if it was not true, then that would imply that a [proven theorem about elliptic curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity_theorem) would be false.
